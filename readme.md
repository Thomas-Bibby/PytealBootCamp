Decentralized Bank:

- Users can deposit their funds into their own bank account
- Users have a 'credit card' account
  - User pays to open the account - 1 Algos for example use
  - They then can withdraw up to 10 Algos from their credit account
    - This will charge the user 11 Algo's the next time they want to get another 10 Algo's plus 1 Algo fee charge
- Admin can withdraw and add to the Pool for credit card payments
